# animated-form
Basic form with an image that tilts as the cursor moves about the page and is clickable to toggle between different color schemes. This is my first attempt at creating a form!

Some things I need to consider and figure out:
    - How to set a max length on input boxes
    - Figure out best practices for CSS custom styling with var()
    
Finished adding basic elements to form, added minimal styling, have not added anything to header body yet.
