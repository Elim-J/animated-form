# animated-form
Basic form with an image that tilts as the cursor moves about the page and is clickable to toggle between different color schemes. This is my first attempt at creating a form!




Some things I need to consider and figure out:
    - How to check if an input box is empty and prevent submission (if input field is required)
    - How to check for certain characters that are needed
    - How to set a max length on input boxes
    - Need to add other kinds of input to get practice with them like radio buttons, select boxes, etc...
    - Should work on adding all form elements first, add small styling, then add image
    - Figure out best practices for CSS custom styling with var()
